# Project Title: Fitness Data Analysis Using NumPy

# Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing the correlation between daily step count and self-reported mood to identify potential relationships and trends. The objective was to explore how physical activity levels might influence emotional well-being.

Using NumPy, I efficiently processed the dataset by performing various calculations, including:
* ✅ Calculating average daily steps and mood scores
* ✅ Identifying trends and patterns in step count and mood variations
* ✅ Exploring potential correlations between physical activity and emotional state

This project not only strengthened my skills in data manipulation with NumPy but also enhanced my ability to derive insights from real-world data. The findings from this analysis could provide valuable insights for promoting healthier lifestyle choices.
